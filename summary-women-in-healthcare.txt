Representation Healthcare continues to outpace other industries in the representation of women however, women especially women of color remain underrepresented at senior levels in healthcare organizations Exhibit 1. Increased representation. At all levels, womens representation in healthcare remains higher than in corporate America overall. Lack of representation in senior levels. But the representation of women drops in each successive career level to a low of 32 percent at the C-suite level. Women in senior-level roles in healthcare are predominantly White. Attrition Higher rates of attrition. Promotions Lower promotion rates. Internal promotion rates for women in healthcare are lower than the average for women in all industries at every level. Healthcare companies can keep a critical eye on the ratio of womens representation at a given level and the share of women hired into that level. Women continue to have higher levels of representation, hiring, and advancement in healthcare than in corporate America overall. The healthcare sector is examining how to better hire and promote women to the highest levels. We identified three important shifts in 2021 increased representation of women at specific managerial levels, lower rates of attrition among women in healthcare than in other sectors, and increased external hiring of women at specific levels of the pipeline.   Increased representation In healthcare, the representation of women at the senior-manager or director level improved by four percentage points on average, to 53 percent, in 2021. Lower rates of attrition On average, in 2021 women left jobs in healthcare at lower rates than women in other sectors, men in healthcare, and women in healthcare in previous years. This effect can compound over time, resulting in lower representation for women at the highest levels. Gender parity and proportionate representation of women of color in healthcare at the top levels remains aspirational.
